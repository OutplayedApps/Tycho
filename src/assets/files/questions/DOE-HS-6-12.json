Which of the following is correct? \r\n \r\nW) The inside of the cell is hypertonic compared to the outside of the cell, so water enters the \r\ncell through osmosis \r\nX) The inside of the cell is hypotonic to the outside of the cell, so water enters the cell through \r\nosmosis \r\nY) The inside and outside of the cell are isotonic, but water enters the cell as the Paramecium \r\nswims around \r\nZ) The cellular processes of the Paramecium produce a lot of excess water, so it needs to get \r\nrid of the extra water",
