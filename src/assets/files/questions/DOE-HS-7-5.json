This family of molecules \r\nis encoded by genes in a wide variety of eukaryotes [yoo-KAR-ee-ohts], ranging from flies to \r\nhumans, and plays an important role in which of the following processes? \r\n \r\nW) Recognizing pathogens in the immune system \r\nX) Breaking down lipids in the digestive system \r\nY) Regulating neurotransmitters in the nervous system \r\nZ) Enabling meiosis [my-OH-sis] in the reproductive system",
