    "bonusQ": "LIFE SCIENCE Multiple Choice On an island, half of one species of birds has small beaks \r\nand the other half has large beaks. A tree with small seeds is very prevalent on the island; \r\nhundreds of years later, the small-beaked birds outnumber the large-beaked birds. According to \r\nthe principles of natural selection, which of the following is the most likely explanation? \r\n \r\nW) Birds with small beaks were better able to fight birds with large beaks \r\nX) Large beaks gradually shrunk due to the smaller available food \r\nY) Birds with small beaks were most likely to forage successfully, and were thus more likely to \r\nreproduce \r\nZ) Birds with large beaks are likely to have more offspring",

    "bonusQ": "GENERAL SCIENCE Multiple Choice The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process is a \r\nmethod that makes it possible to replicate DNA segments in a very short amount of time using \r\nalternating periods of heating and cooling. The periods of heating would denature most proteins, \r\nsuch as DNA polymerases [pol-uh-muh-RAYS-uhs], and make them nonfunctional, especially \r\nat the high temperatures used during PCR. How is this obstacle overcome in modern PCR \r\nreactions? \r\n \r\nW) DNA polymerase is added between each period of heating and cooling \r\nX) The DNA polymerase used is from a species of bacteria that live in hot springs, so the DNA \r\npolymerase can function at high temperatures \r\nY) RNA polymerase is more heat resistant and is used instead, and then the DNA is reverse \r\ntranscribed from the RNA \r\nZ) DNA polymerases in most species are proteins that do not denature easily, so this process \r\ncan function at high temperatures",
