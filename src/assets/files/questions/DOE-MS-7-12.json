Since these diseases \r\nare caused by recessive genes, one might think that they should have been eliminated long \r\nago. What is the leading theory on why diseases like cystic fibrosis still exist? \r\n \r\nW) Individuals with the disease are able to have children before the effects of the disease \r\nemerge \r\nX) A single recessive allele of the gene causing the disease may confer a selective advantage \r\nY) Two copies of the recessive allele of the gene causing the disease may confer a selective \r\nadvantage \r\nZ) Individuals that are heterozygous [het-er-uh-ZY-guhs] for the gene causing the disease are \r\nas healthy as normal individuals",
