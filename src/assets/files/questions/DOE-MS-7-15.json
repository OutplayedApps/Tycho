Which of the following would NOT be sufficient to do so? \r\n \r\nW) Observe that the ball is actually an extremely thin shell, and measure its mass in grams and \r\nits outer radius in meters \r\nX) Measure the ball\u2019s mass in grams, its inner radius in meters, and its outer radius in meters \r\nY) Suspend the ball from a wire oscillating in simple harmonic motion with a known torsional \r\nrestoring constant K, and measure the velocity of the ball at the lowest point of its oscillation \r\nZ) Suspend the ball from a wire oscillating in simple harmonic motion with a known torsional \r\nrestoring constant K, and measure the period of the ball",
