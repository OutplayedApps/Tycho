      What is Tycho?
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      Tycho is a mobile app that allows people both to access packets and to access study guides for academic competitions such as quizbowl.

      Why was it made?
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      We found that downloading quizbowl packets from the website is not a very easy experience, especially on mobile phones, as one has to open .docx files and unzip archives. Tycho contains all the quizbowl packets in a user-friendly, easy-to-use way.
      Additionally, it may be hard to start out as a new quizbowl player without some guidance as to what to study and how to study it. That's what we hope our guides are useful for!

      I'm a developer. Where can I find the code?
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      You're in luck! The app is open source and developed using the Ionic framework, a cross-platform mobile app development platform that uses Angular 2.
