      What is Tycho? What is quizbowl? What is science bowl?
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      Tycho is a mobile app that allows people to practice for academic competitions such as Science Bowl and Quizbowl.<br>
        Science Bowl is a buzzer-based competition sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy conducted at the local, regional, and national levels.<br>
        Quizbowl is a buzzer-based competition, but it is based on longer, pyramidal questions in many different academic categories such as science, literature, history, philosophy, geography, music, and more.
      <br><br>
      <b>Note: </b> This app is not affiliated with the U.S. DOE or other quizbowl organizations. The science bowl questions are freely available on the public domain from the <a href="javascript:window.open('https://science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/regional-competitions/resources', '_system');">DOE website.</a>
      <br>
      The quizbowl questions are used from the
        <a href="javascript:window.open('https://www.quizdb.org/', '_system');">QuizDB database</a>,
        which contains sets posted publicly on the <a href="javascript:window.open('http://quizbowlpackets.com/', '_system');">Quizbowl Resource Center.</a>
